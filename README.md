# EECS731_Shakespeare
Project assignment two for Introduction to Data Science

Shakespeare is well known for his plays. In all the created plays, multiple characters exist with various lines. Using text and line data from Shakespeare's plays, can the character be classified? To further breakdown the problem, certain characters appear in only certain plays. This provides better dependency for character detection. Furthermore, characters only appear in certain scenes. By parsing the act/scene line, it's possible to take this into consideration. Lastly, certain terms are more frequent among certain players compared to other players. With these features, it is possible to correctly classify.

In this project, two classifiers are used: Random Forest and Naive Bayes.
